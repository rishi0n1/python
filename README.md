Handwriting character recognition is an ongoing field of research. Handwriting recognition will 
take handwritten characters as input and predict the character using machine learning algorithm. 
There are many different types of algorithms which can be used for recognition. The important 
things in handwriting recognition are preprocessing the data properly and selecting the best 
algorithm. Handwriting datasets are vague in nature because there may not always be sharp and 
perfectly straight lines. The main goal in recognition is feature extraction is to remove the 
redundancy from the data and gain a more effective embodiment of the word image through a set 
of numerical attributes. CNN is best to perform with image datasets. CNN is capable of finding 
complex patterns this makes CNN better to use for handwriting recognition.
